NOTE - THIS IS A FORKED REPOSITORY OF THE ORIGINAL MOD (I took permission from the creator)

This mod just increases the attack and health of the man by changing just a few properties. It is recommended to use this
mod with gun mods like tacz or mods which add one shot weapons or something idk (this mod was intended for tacz anyways).











# Man From The Fog
Mod which adds a creepy creature, which stalks you in the night and preys on you.
## What does it do?
Minecraft is not a horror game, but what if it was? This mod's creature, called The Man, which will scare your socks off by being surprising and unexpected, it was inspired by The Man From The Fog by Ma_Do, the main reason I did this, is balancing issues in the original, it was first intended to be only a rewrite, but I decided to also make a new model and change the sounds, trying to make it as creepy and frightening as possible
